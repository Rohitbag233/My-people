                I met this boy & when I was in 7th Std and it was about to end.<br>
                There were 2 months left for the last semester exam of the 7th std, then one day the teacher made me sit beside him.<br>
                At first, as an introvert, I didn't talk to anyone there but soon, because of his friendly nature, we started talking. We used to share our notes, and I actually took his notes most of the time because I was very slow at writing and my handwriting was also very bad.<br>
                Actually, our friendship started from 8th. And there I found that we had similar interests. We used to talk a lot, and this was the first time I felt like I had the most precious treasure, but it would soon prove me wrong.<br>
                Then one day, I decided to bring my imaginative world to life, so I started talking about past hypothetical stories. By the way, I'm also writing a story, and soon, I will make an animation series and movies out of it. Because of this, he used to enjoy going to school.<br>
                When I came home after school, I used to eagerly wait for the next day. He also shared my stories with the students in the class, so I started getting more attention. I felt like a very rich and famous personality.<br>
                Then I also started predicting the future with my imagination in school, and we started making plans for our future. We thought we would be working in top tech giant companies, including ISRO and NASA. I know this sounds silly and funny.<br>
                Everything was fine, but when I was at the end of the 8th std, suddenly the lockdown was announced, and the schools were closed. Online classes were going on, and I used to watch YouTube during class and chat with him on WhatsApp. We were also working on a project together, finding some discoveries or business ideas that could make us rich and help us achieve our dreams.<br>
                Before this, we thought about 2-3 ideas, but they weren't very reliable. Then, suddenly, after a few weeks, when I was drinking water from a plastic bottle, I noticed the cap mechanism of the bottle and got an idea. I rushed to the kitchen with a pen and paper, locked the door, and started planning. After making a decent plan, I showed it to him the next day.<br>
                Actually, this event was going on after Diwali. Back to the lockdown event, I had gone to my village, and I used to talk privately. Everyone there thought I was talking to my girlfriend, which was embarrassing. Due to this, my relatives started spying on me, and at that time, I was very uncomfortable. On top of that, I was mentally very weak, and suicidal thoughts were also coming.<br>
                Now I see these moments as so stupid, but anyhow, due to this, my relations with relatives went very bad, and I think I could never show my face to them. But still, it was not a big deal because I believed we would achieve massive success. Also, it was going that way.
