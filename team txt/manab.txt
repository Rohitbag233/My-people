Hi, this is about Manab , 
Actually I dont really know or remember and how we meet but ,
I still clearly remember every time we have spent togethers. 
If I say roughly then as how much I could remember is that when 
I 1 year old he was  born and at time we used to live in same building, 
but after 2-3 year he got shifted ta another building. 
I used to got to his house to play at the evening . 
As he was slightly rice than me, so he would has 3x times. 
more toy than me and they were of good quality. but that dosn't matter, we played and enjoyed a lot. 
Although he dose not belive me truely but still show his instrusted on the stuff ,I used to talk.
 Actually my most of the memories have  blessed out as he was a part of my childhood but I will try to write the most of it.
 when I was at 3rd, 4th used to go to a common tuition with him.
 I still the torture of the tution teacher when she tell us to eat the Spicy green chillis. 
and also sometimes they used to remove our do clothes and bully us but this not the point
 Actually he also good at studies like me although he was studying in a one  lower standard then me but used to give proper competition  to old my marks. 
And was also havings mindset for success. 
He wearted to became a buissness man. 
And are more thing when I was small. His parents give me some  of the toy he have and that made me very happy and
joyfull . I have so many memories with him  but most infortunaly i am unable to remeber it . hmm One more thing ,we where in same school
