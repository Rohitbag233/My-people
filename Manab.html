                Hi, this is about Manab,<br>
                Actually I dont really know or remember and how we meet but,<br>
                I still clearly remember every time we have spent togethers.<br>
                If I say roughly then as how much I could remember is that when<br>
                I 1 year old he was  born and at time we used to live in same building,<br>
                but after 2-3 year he got shifted to another building.<br>
                I used to go to his house to play in the evening.<br>
                As he was slightly older than me, he had 3x more toys than me, and they were of good quality, but that doesn't matter; we played and enjoyed a lot.<br>
                Although he doesn't believe me truly, he still showed interest in the stuff I used to talk about.<br>
                Actually, most of my memories have faded as he was a part of my childhood, but I will try to write the most of it.<br>
                When I was in 3rd or 4th grade, I used to go to a common tuition with him.<br>
                I still remember the torture of the tuition teacher when she made us eat the spicy green chillis.<br>
                And sometimes they used to remove our clothes and bully us, but that's not the point.<br>
                Actually, he was also good at studies like me, although he was studying in a lower grade than me, he used to give me proper competition for my marks.<br>
                And he had a mindset for success.<br>
                He wanted to become a businessman.<br>
                And there are more things from when I was small. His parents gave me some of the toys he had, and that made me very happy and joyful.<br>
                I have so many memories with him, but unfortunately, I am unable to remember most of them.<br>
                Hmm, one more thing, we were in the same school.<br>
