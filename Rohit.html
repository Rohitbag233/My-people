                Hi, I am Rohit from 2016.<br>
                Actually, yeh Rohit mein hi hoon the Tiger Rohit.<br>
                In 2016, I had a broken hand (Left hand above). It was Wednesday and I was having my train scheduled for Friday,<br>
                but the day when I broke my hand, I was in my village and the orthopedic was available only twice a week.<br>
                So, I didn't get the treatment that day, but fortunately in my massi's house, there was a neighbor who was an assistant orthopedic doctor<br>
                and he did a temporary plaster of my hand. Then after 3 days, a serious doctor did an operation on my hand and after 21 days,<br>
                when I recovered, it was found that the operation was not done properly and my hand was a little bit bent. I could fold my hand without any problem,<br>
                but keeping my hand free in a normal position made it look bad and ugly. Also, when I walked, it used to look very bad.<br>
                So, my parents decided to do a reoperation of my hand and after consulting the doctor, we decided to do the reoperation after 10th grade.<br>
                Due to this event, I was mentally very unstable. I was like a tornado of emotions. Due to this, I got bullied many times in my school, tuition,<br>
                on the building ground, by people, my friends, and my neighbors.<br>
                Due to this, I got disconnected from the outer world. I used to stay at home all the time. I started hallucinating things.<br>
                So, I used to talk to myself the whole day.<br>
                Then, to overcome my social anxiety, I started going out in front of my building.<br>
                Suddenly one day, around 12:45 AM, when I was at the roadside of the garden,<br>
                a futuristic supercar came beside me. I had never seen that type of car before.<br>
                It was so luxurious; its cost might be 5-6 crore. Then suddenly, a 24-26-year-old man came out and said, "I am Rohit."<br>
                Then he told me to sit in his car and have a short drive. Actually, I should not have gone with him, but now I think it was the best decision of my life.<br>
                Actually, now I think he came from the future to guide myself.<br>
                It was feeling like he was a Rohit, but from the future. Actually, he helped me to find myself and told me the purpose of my life<br>
                and also showed me the reality of the world.<br>
                Actually, this is so sci-fi, but I don't know what it was. Okay, let's move on to the next.<br>
                After that, I started finding a way to achieve my dream goal. I was interested in science. I thought that with expertise in science,<br>
                I could achieve those goals. So, I started diving into science for new discoveries.<br>
                I started studying articles, documentaries, and following idols in the science field. It was like I was getting out of my depression and<br>
                I didn't care about other people's thoughts. Everything was going normal from 7th, 8th grades.<br>
                Then, actually, I was working on a traveling technology with my friend named 'SUJAN'.<br>
                And he was my first best friend. Actually, he was the first trustworthy person in my life.
